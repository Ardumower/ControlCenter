## Description
Develop an open source robotic lawn mower (HW+SW reference platform)

This is the Ardumower control center, a web interface to observe sensor data, manual control the mower or 
to just watch camera stream. This project uses Node-RED and runs on a Raspberry PI inside the mower.

WARNING: it is possible to manual control the mower. Do this at your own risk and be aware that manual control
has some bugs. Don't hurt yourself or someone else and ensure your mower will not drive to your neighbours garden, roads
or other areas. NEVER use manual control over internet
